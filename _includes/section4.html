            <p>The film has strong themes of PJ’s fascination with powerful female figures like his mother. His mother’s
                strong presence in his life has influenced a fascination and admiration for the Wicked Witch from a
                young age. His mother is played by his biological mother, Maggie. PJ’s ninety three year old
                grandfather, Joe Hardy, plays the wizard himself, soaring high into the sky in a hot air balloon. This
                is something that his grandfather used to do quite often. Mr. Hardy fits the wizard archetype due to his
                entrepreneurial trajectory from a small town man with big dreams. Throughout the film, PJ intercuts VHS
                footage and old family photos to aide in the justification of the characters in the film.
